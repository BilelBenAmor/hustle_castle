## 2. Upgrade item grade and level

Currently, players who invested on items on particular level, lose all their progress by simply upgrading throne room and going to the next item level.

The main goal of the feature is to give player the ability to upgrade any item grade and level so all items keep their importance and value.

As result, the feature opens the door to introduce more higher levels and grades in the future without making players losing all their current progress.

This feature is a great opportunity for exploring the iron resources as it will become one of the requirements to upgrade item level.

> **Important**
>
> Same special item (obtained from event) could not be presented in the same grade. In other word, when player has simultaneously a weapon from the 7th and 4th grades, the one from 4th grade could upgraded at most to the 6th grade (unless break apart the one from higher grade).
> If the case exists for some players, compensation should be distributed (e.g: diamonds, premium, goblin...).

- 7th grade (ultimate): 86-100.

> **Important**
>
> Currently, some items have level borders (82-89) instaed of specific level (84). A migration should be done, and they become with their higher level border (e.g: item with border 82-89 will be 89).

### 2.2. Upgrade grade and level requirements

### 3.3. Add gem slot amount

> **Note**
>
> Adding gem slot must fill the limit condition and cannot exceed the maximum supported gem slots number. In other word, if an item from 5th grade with with epic rarity, and having initially 3 gem slots, adding new slot is denied.
>
> Additionally, the new added gem slot is randomly selected. So, if it does not match the desired one, then changing gem slot should be applied.

| Item rarity  | Common | Uncommon | Rare | Epic | Legendary | Mythic | Divine |
|--------------|--------|----------|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Drill amount | 1      | 2        | 3    | 4    | 5         | 7      | 10     |

| Item rarity | Common  | Uncommon | Rare    | Epic     | Legendary | Mythic   | Divine   |
|-------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Gold amount | 4500000 | 7000000  | 9500000 | 12000000 | 15000000  | 18500000 | 24000000 |

> **Warning**
>
> Gold amount could be also calculated based on throne room level.

### 3.4. Change gem slot amount

> **Note**
>
> The successful gem slot changing percentage is calculated based on the magic scroll capability. In other words, if the used magic scroll doesn't provide 100% chance, the missing percentage will increase the chance to give a random gem slot.

## 4. Include artifact and totem in the set

The main goal of the feature is to include artifact and totem in the ancient (supreme and immortal) set. As result, the set will count 8 items with additional abilities compared to the current one.

Item polish and enchantment should be applicable as well for artifact and totem. This will increase their attributes and their abilities.

### 4.1. Amount of set production for totem and artifact

It could be the same as the ring and amulet.

### 4.2. Amount of polish for totem and artifact

It could follow the same mechanism as the other items.

### 4.3. Amount of enchantment for totem and atrifact

It could follow the same mechanism as the other items.

## 5. Item balancing

If we look for items (all items types even runes and alliances) in different places (events, arena store, titan store...) from the begining of the game, it's clear that all abilities/attributes are not balanced.
(e.g: some of them deal 10000 damage and others 200000, some of them have healing abilities with 15000 and others with 150000).

The same issue is presented with ancient sets, new sets are more powerful than old ones.

This reason makes the majority of players ignoring old stuff, and using only new one, and it's one of the critical factors that makes players have the same squad.

> **Important**
>
> This feature is the most easiest one in terms of complexity, but it's the most tiring one since it requires intensive tests to reach the goal.

## 6. New rarities for gem and alliances

With new arriving rarities, gem and alliances may undergo new levels to enhance their power and attributes.

### 6.1. Gem rarities upgrade

> **Note**
>
> Amount could be calculated based on the actual upgrading amount for existing rarities.

Possible rarities:

- Common.
- Uncommon.
- Rare.
- Epic.
- Legendary.
- Ancient.
- Supreme (could not be mythic since the previous level is ancient).
- Immortel (could not be divine since the previous level is supreme).

> **Important**
>
> Actual divine gems should be replaced by supreme gems.

### 6.2. Alliances rarities upgrade

> **Note**
>
> Upgrade resources could be diamonds with iron/wood/new resource or material type.

Possible rarities:

- Rare.
- Epic.
- Legendary.
- Ancient.
- Supreme (could not be mythic since the previous level is ancient).
- Immortel (could not be divine since the previous level is supreme).

To upgrade alliance rarity, the alliance should be upgraded to its max level first.

> **Important**
>
> New alliance with supreme or immortal rarity could be obtained directly from a new portfolio (enormous and gigantic).

## 7. Gameplay and castle review

### 7.1. Restriction on playing time/volume

The goal of the feature is to decrease the number of bots that already invade the game. To do that, some restrictions could be applied to give more control for abnormal activities:

- Make a limit for playing time (e.g: 12 hours per day).
- Make a limit for playing volume per battle type:
  - 35 tournaments in the arena per day.
  - 8 runs in the gembay per day.
  - 100 battles on the lighthouse per day.
  - 25 runs in the dark cathedral per day.
  - 25 runs in the dungeon per day.
  - 100 battles in the colosseum per day.
- Make a limit for purchasing amounts (with diamonds or real money).

### 7.2. Improve matchmaking

The goal of the feature is to balance battles by looking for opponents that are really close in terms of squad power. Some ideas could improve the actual algorithm in order to make battles (especially in arena) more equitable:

- Consider fighters that are fully equipped, because some players focus on only 2 or 3 fighters and leave the rest of the squad with dummy residents or partially equipped.
- Consider fighter classes for the entire squad.
- In arena, the search engine should ensure that difference between the most powerful squad and least powerful squad must not exceed 15% of the power average (e.g: the least powerful squad is 17500000 and the most powerful squad is 22500000 since the average is 20000000).

### 7.3. Hide opponent items

The opponent fighter items on the battle preview, on battle result or directly on his castle view should be hidden or could be dependent on player privacy (he could choose to hide or show his items), so only fighter statistic screen is accessible and itmes are no longer clickable.
Special skins (from events or sets) remain visible on items but no more details (depending on player privacy) about attributes and abilities. General stats remain visible, like power, health, damage, crit etc.

As result, there will be less chance to have redundant players with the same squad.

### 7.4. Rework on battle statistics

Actually, when the battle finishes, different statistics are displayed indicating damage done or taken, health restored, critical or dodged attacks, killed fighters etc.
This screen could be enriched as well with abilities activation/ban and their frequency (how many times and how much it takes to activate). This will give players the ability to understand more from where their power/weakness comes from and give them more control on their available items.

### 7.5. Add more levels

Levels could be added to portal, titan towers and cathedral difficulty since opponents become too easy to be beaten regarding players power.

Levels could be added as well for resources store especially for apples.

### 7.6. Remove unnecessary rooms from castle

Currently, there 2 useless rooms in the castle:

- The healing room since fighters are healed with the same amount after battle even if they are out of this room.
- The trophies room. There is no added value from this room.

## 8. Event management

Here are some ideas that could be applied to events to make them more interesting:

- Make event items testable like the pal in the pal event.
- Decrease passes amount and make them more interesting. Pass could affect the event items rarity, by default, legendary is available, and if taking first pass rarity becomes mythic and if buying second pass items become divine.
- New saling/exchange event, during it, members in the same clan are able to exchange items with some prices (diamonds, gold, mythril, etc) with each others.
- Event frequency: one event per month and it should last for 1 week.
- Each event type should only focus on one type of equipments: rune event (nothing else), engraving event (nothing else), titan event (nothing else), pal event (nothing else), set event (nothing else), alliance event (nothing else), full fighter event (weapon, armor, souls, jewellery, artifact, totem and nothing else), skin and workers event (nothing else).
- Rune event should offer only new ones: it's unfair because old players that have played all rune events have the same runes as a new player who played only the last rune event.
- New sets are only introduced in winter/spring/summer/autumn festivals and then, their materials will become available in other playing mode (arena, gembay, portal, etc) after 6 months or one year for example.
